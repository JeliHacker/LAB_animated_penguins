# LAB_animated_penguins
Create a visualization that displays all of the quizzes as points for one penguin. Then create a set of "buttons", one for each penguin. When someone presses a button, they will see an animation that will transition from the present penguin's grades to the new penguin's grades. The term button is very loose here. You may use a set of image as buttons (preferred), or just a set of labeled buttons. In either case, this should be generated by d3, not by typing each one out.
